## Interface

<img width='720px' src='./readme/interface.png'>

From there, you can simply either backup your data, compare two different backups, or download your songs with ease.

## How to use
When typing your **osu! path**, the default osu! folder is shown by default, in case you dont know where it is. *We'll warn you if [we don't know either](https://github.com/KarboXXX/backosu/issues).*

When **backing up**, you can select the folder you want the backup to be created in, no worries with backing up using an external drive. *(although the backup is just a text file with names and download links)*

When **comparing two lists**, you'll need to select two files, giving their path, either by typing, or clicking "**Search**" and selecting them.
